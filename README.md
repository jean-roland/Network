## Presentation

This is a project example to showcase my network library that handles Ethernet, ARP, IP, ICMP echo and UDP protocols.

It is meant to be used in an embedded environment, therefore it will work when interfaced with target specific libraries (phy/mac ethernet driver and timer).

The corresponding libraries included in this project are mock-ups.

## How to use

To use the library in your project:
* Download the source code.
* Follow implementation example found in `src/custom_main.c`.
* Replace mock-ups with your own functions.

## Documentation

You can read the Doxygen generated documentation [here](./doc/html/index.html).

This is a project exemple to showcase my network library that handles Ethernet, ARP, IP, ICMP echo and UDP protocols.

It is meant to be used in an embedded environment, therefore it will work when interfaced with target specific libraries (mac controller and timer/counter).

The corresponding libraries included in this project are mock-ups.

This specific project is a bare metal implementation of the library.
